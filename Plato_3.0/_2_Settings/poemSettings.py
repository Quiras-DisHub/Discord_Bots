	As silken locks wave in the breeze of dawn;
	And delicate lips part with a yawn.
	A sunshine rises from her sleep;
	Only to fall back in a heap.
	With her hair a mess;
	And a smile that can bless.
	She rises once more;
	Oh there is much to adore.
	Those starlite eyes;
	Dancing like Butterflies.
	Though this poem is at its end;
	Please don't cry.
	For it is never thee end;
	If you belive in I.""",
    
	"""
	A thousand hearts of gold;
	Lay in fields shinning bold.
	Only one heart of coal.
	In this land;
	Taken has the toll.""",
    
	"""
	Many a nights have I lain;
	As my heart aches in pain.
	Yet on the morrow;
	I cry out in sorrow.
	Through the waves it does come;
	Just as steady as a plumb.
	Drowning and lost in habit;
	Is the one saved by the life jacket.""",
    
	"""
	People have often asked;
	How deaf life is as they passed.
	The roar of the sea;
	Hushed at my feet.
	The calamity of a crowd;
	Soundless words all around.
	The world like a wheel without grease;
	Yet to me it is a world of peace.""",
	
	"""
	Pulled from a world of blue;
	Soaring into a world of blue.
	Changing to many a child's mind;
	Coming together and growing blinds.
	Streaking now down a pane;
	We see this drop of rain.""",
	
	"""
	As darkness does fall;
	The critters begin to crawl.
	They slither and slide;
	As one tries to hide.
	They creep and invade;
	This mind that's made.""",
	
	"""
	Flinching from thee unkown;
	Will let it be known.
	The fist through a wall;
	That bears it all.
	Running though the night;
	Reveals the mental fight.
	Before falling to the ground;
	As one's heart does pound.""",
	
	"""
	I once felt like a thousand pieces scattered by the wind.
	Now those pieces have grown together stronger then before.""",
	
	"""
	The great owl so wise;
	Is silent as it flies.
	You can run with a Cheetah;
	Who will always beat-ya
	The memory of an elephant;
	Nothing in nature can vent.
	Yet even these can not endure;
	A hundred ant or fewer.""",
	
	"""
	I often sit alone;
	Just as still as a bone.
	Feeling much less;
	As I am still worthless.
	I am ever near the edge;
	While flaws my mind does dredge.""",
	
	"""
	Streaking they glide;
	As they fall from the eye.
	Spreading and fading;
	The ink laid down.
	Nothing done but evading;
	Merely to hide a frown.
	Hidden from the rear;
	Is the life of a tear.""",
	
	"""
	In a world a roar;
	Where everthing is a bore.
	One may find peace;
	In these sheets of fleece.
	As begins the fun;
	At the rising of the sun.""",
	
	"""
	Laid down to rest;
	Often are the best.
	Monsters they have slain;
	Yet nothing is in vain
	Tiss the life forever;
	The Life of a Mother.""",

	A slow warm breeze;
	Carries butterflies past the knees.
	Green leaves rustling around;
	Birds sing above the ground.
	Higher still the clouds float by;
	As they shade you and I.""",
	
	"""
	A poem of the heart;
	This is quite the start.
	As one stops to ask;
	Laid forth is thy task.
	A battle is to be waged;
	With many whom not yet aged.
	The heart so delicate and frail;
	hines behind her veil.
	You see her now;
	Stepping back to bow.
	Catching your hand in hers;
	Around the garden inters.
	Though this poem has gone arrie;
	It must be seen through the eye.
	For love is like a glove;
	Ever so does it fly swift as a dove""",

	Darkness falls upon the night;
	Through pitch ye give up might.
	Have you seen me cry;
	This night I will not die.""",

	The mind is mystifying,
	With a multitude of personas.
	Traumatized it shatters,
	Yet in shadows everything lies.""",

	It was late at night,
	When began the fight.
	I was alone in my room,
	Seemingly destined to doom.
	Out the bedroom door,
	Mindlessly to the ground floor.
	Thoughts racing,
	With feet pacing.
	Walking outside into the night,
	All the thoughts take flight.
	I run long and hard,
	Till you see bridge guard.
	The mind set on fire,
	The body bent with desire.
	Railing is no wall,
	For this bridge so tall.
	Over the edge and down,
	Far below is where you drown.
	Over swept by emotion,
	As wild as the ocean.""",
	
	"""
	There came a time when all was dark,
	Then came a man with a lot to hark.
	With thoughts of glass sealed fire,
	Many people called him a liar.
	He tried and failed,
	Was told he should bail.
	He believed by power he was able,
	The bulb was then lighted by cable""",

	Far beyond thee atmosphere,

	There are many who seek,

	Many lives have been liven,
	As countless orders were given.
	Some even paid their rent,
	While many rounds were spent.
	Even fewer have laughed,
	While thousands are aghast.
	In this is a lesson,
	That many stand at attention.
	They say, on any given day.
	All gave some, yet some gave all.
	So I ask you now,
	Lower your head to bow.
	It matters not your culture,
	Say thank you to the soldier.
	They fought with Honor, Dignity, and Bravery,
	They might be Conner, Felicity, or Hennery
	You cannot have a kingdom,
	Without first your freedom.
	Patriots do fall,

	Beyond the snow frosted trees,
	And brightly lit eaves. 
	Lays a house quaint and old,

	She is an angel in disguise,
	Somedays she goes out and flys.

	With a guise no more,
	She fly's evermore.
	Always in the sky,
	Forever in I."""
